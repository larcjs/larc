Hi HN! Creator here.

LARC solves two pain points I hit when building with Web Components:

1. **Coordination:** Web Components are silos. They can't communicate without
   tight coupling. PAN (Page Area Network) provides a lightweight message bus
   so components coordinate without knowing about each other.

2. **Development friction:** No one wants to run webpack to add a card component.
   LARC loads components automatically—just write HTML and refresh your browser.

Technical highlights:
• 5KB core (gzipped), zero dependencies
• 261 tests passing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
• Works with React, Vue, Svelte—mix and match
• TypeScript support
• Published on npm (@larcjs/core@2.0.0)

Live playground: https://larcjs.github.io/larc/playground/

The "killer" demo is the hybrid dashboard—React, Vue, and LARC components
on the same page, coordinating via PAN messages. No framework knows
about the others.

New this week: CLI tool (create-larc-app), component registry, and VS Code extension.

Philosophy: Zero-build in dev for fast iteration. Optional build in prod
for optimization. Framework complement, not replacement.

Happy to answer questions!

## 🎯 Alternative First Comments

### Shorter Version (If needed)
```
Hi HN! Built LARC to solve the Web Component "silo problem."

The core insight: Web Components need a coordination layer. PAN (Page Area Network)
provides lightweight pub/sub messaging so components communicate without coupling.

Tech: 5KB core, 261 tests, works with React/Vue/Svelte, TypeScript support.

Playground: https://larcjs.github.io/larc/playground/
Hybrid demo: React + Vue + LARC components coordinating via PAN messages.

Just shipped: CLI tool (create-larc-app), component registry, VS Code extension.

Zero-build dev, optional build prod. Complement frameworks, don't replace them.

Questions welcome!

### With More Context Version
```
Hi HN! I'm the creator of LARC.

**The problem:** Web Components are great for encapsulation but terrible for
coordination. Every component is an island. Making them work together requires
custom integration code, defeating the purpose of reusable components.

**The solution:** PAN (Page Area Network) - a message bus for Web Components.

Think MQTT for the browser. Components publish and subscribe to topics.
A theme toggle publishes "theme.changed", cards/tables/modals subscribe
and update automatically. No coupling, no imports, no framework required.

**Why it matters:**
• Reduce framework overhead 60%+ (5KB core vs 140KB React)
• True framework interop (React, Vue, Svelte on same page)
• Zero build in dev (write code, refresh browser)
• No vendor lock-in (it's just Web Components + messaging)

**What's new (this week):**
• create-larc-app CLI tool
• Component registry with web UI
• VS Code extension

**Technical details:**
• 261 tests passing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
• 0 vulnerabilities (npm audit)
• TypeScript support
• Published to npm (@larcjs/core@2.0.0)

**Try it:**
Playground: https://larcjs.github.io/larc/playground/
Hybrid demo: https://larcjs.github.io/examples/hybrid-dashboard.html

**Get started:**
```bash
npx create-larc-app my-app
```

Philosophy: LARC is designed for zero-build development while supporting
optimized builds for production. Fast iteration + optimal delivery.

I'm here all day to answer questions!

## 🎯 Key Talking Points

Keep these ready for comments:

1. **vs React/Vue:** Complement, not replace. Keep React for complex UIs.
2. **Why Web Components:** Only true framework-agnostic solution.
3. **Production ready:** 261 tests, 0 vulnerabilities, v1.1 on npm.
4. **Bundle size:** 5KB vs 140KB (React) or 90KB (Vue).
5. **PAN bus:** Like MQTT for browser—pub/sub messaging.
6. **Zero build:** Write .mjs files, refresh browser. No webpack required.
7. **Learning curve:** HTML + vanilla JS knowledge is enough.
8. **TypeScript:** Full support with @larcjs/core-types.
9. **Browser support:** Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+.
10. **Community:** Young (Nov 2024) but growing. Early adopter opportunity.
