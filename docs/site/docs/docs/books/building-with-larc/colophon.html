<h2>About the Cover Animal</h2>
<p>The animal on the cover of <em>Building with LARC</em> is a <strong>North American Beaver</strong> (<em>Castor canadensis</em>), one of nature's most accomplished engineers and builders. Beavers are large, semi-aquatic rodents native to North America, known for their remarkable ability to modify their environment through the construction of dams, lodges, and canals.</p>
<p>Adult beavers typically weigh between 35-65 pounds and measure 3-4 feet in length, including their distinctive flat, paddle-shaped tail. Their dense, waterproof fur provides excellent insulation in cold water, while webbed hind feet make them powerful swimmers. The beaver's most recognizable features are its large, continuously growing incisors - sharp orange teeth that can fell trees up to 3 feet in diameter.</p>
<p>Beavers are legendary for their construction skills. Using branches, logs, mud, and stones, they build elaborate dams that create ponds and wetlands, fundamentally reshaping their ecosystem. These structures can span hundreds of feet and last for decades, sometimes even centuries with regular maintenance. The engineering is sophisticated: dams are typically built with a curved shape to better withstand water pressure, and beavers continuously monitor and repair their structures, plugging leaks and reinforcing weak points.</p>
<p>Their lodges - dome-shaped homes built from sticks and mud - feature underwater entrances for protection from predators, with living chambers positioned above the waterline. Inside, these chambers remain remarkably warm even during harsh winters, thanks to excellent insulation and the occupants' body heat.</p>
<p>Beavers work primarily at night and are highly industrious, with family groups collaborating on construction projects. They communicate through tail slaps on the water (warning signals), scent marking, and vocalizations. Their tree-felling technique is methodical: they gnaw around the trunk in an hourglass pattern until the tree falls, then section it into manageable pieces for transport and use.</p>
<p>We chose the Beaver for this book because, like these master builders, software architecture requires careful planning, solid engineering principles, and the ability to construct complex systems from simple components. The beaver's methodical approach to building - starting with a foundation, reinforcing structures, and creating systems that serve multiple purposes - mirrors the best practices in software development. Just as beaver dams create thriving ecosystems, well-built applications create value for entire communities of users.</p>
<h2>About the Cover Illustration</h2>
<p>The cover illustration was hand-drawn by the author using pen and ink, photographed, and refined in Photoshop. The woodcut-style engraving technique echoes the natural history illustrations of 18th and 19th century field guides and the iconic animal covers of O'Reilly Media's technical books. The beaver is depicted sitting alertly on a log with wood chips nearby - a working builder surveying its domain - which seemed particularly fitting for a reference manual about building applications. The detailed cross-hatching captures the texture of the beaver's fur and the grain of the wood, reflecting both the precision of the craft and the artistry involved.</p>
<h2>Fonts</h2>
<p>The text typeface is Adobe Minion Pro, the display typeface is Myriad Pro, and the code typeface is Ubuntu Mono. The book was typeset using Pandoc and LaTeX.</p>
<h2>Production Notes</h2>
<p>This book was authored in Markdown using a modular structure with 25 chapters, 7 appendices, and a comprehensive index. The content was converted to multiple formats (HTML, PDF, and EPUB) using Pandoc. All code examples were tested against LARC version 3.x and validated for correctness.</p>
<p>The book follows O'Reilly's tradition of comprehensive technical documentation: starting with philosophy and context, moving through practical implementation, and concluding with exhaustive API reference material. The structure was inspired by classic programming references like <em>Programming Perl</em> and <em>Programming Python</em>, which balance narrative explanation with detailed technical specifications.</p>
<p>The build system itself was designed to embody LARC's philosophy: it works without complex toolchains, uses standard tools (Pandoc, LaTeX), and produces professional results with minimal configuration. In a meta sense, the build script is a small LARC application - taking structured inputs and producing multiple coordinated outputs.</p>
<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>Special thanks to the LARC community for their contributions, feedback, and real-world usage patterns that informed many sections of this book. Thanks also to Christopher Robison for his vision in creating LARC and his commitment to web standards and developer ergonomics.</p>
