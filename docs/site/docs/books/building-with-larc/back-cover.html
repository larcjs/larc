        <h1>Learning LARC</h1>
<h2>The Web Has Grown Up. It's Time Our Apps Did Too.</h2>
<p>Modern browsers aren't the brittle playgrounds they once were. They're fast, secure, richly capable application platforms — yet most of today's development stacks still treat them like dumb terminals that need layers of tooling, bundling, and framework magic just to function.</p>
<strong>Learning LARC</strong> shows another path.
<p>LARC embraces the browser as a mature runtime, using nothing but open standards — Web Components, modules, events, and message buses — to build complex, deeply interactive applications without build systems, without monoliths, and without ceremony. Through clear narrative examples and real architectural stories, this book teaches you how to design apps as ecosystems: small parts, clearly defined, communicating through a shared bus.</p>
<p>You'll learn how to structure large systems out of tiny cooperating modules, expose capabilities through message patterns instead of global state, keep your interfaces clean, and let the platform do the heavy lifting it was built for.</p>
<p>No bundlers. No scaffolding. No twenty-layer dependency stacks. Just the browser, finally treated like the grown-up it is.</p>
<p>Whether you're maintaining a legacy system or starting fresh, <strong>Learning LARC</strong> will help you rethink how modern web apps can — and should — be built.</p>
<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Christopher Robison is a veteran software engineer and architect with nearly three decades of experience building systems that range from biotech and online trading platforms to complex web applications and AI-driven tools. A lifelong maker with a deep appreciation for open standards, he has spent his career exploring the boundaries of what the web can do when you stop fighting the platform and start embracing it.</p>
<p>He is the creator of LARC.js and the PAN message bus, a browser-native architecture inspired by the elegant simplicity of the automotive CAN bus. His work blends engineering pragmatism with a playful curiosity that has led him to design everything from 3D printers and robotics to interactive music systems and decentralized applications.</p>
<p>Christopher currently lives in San Francisco, where he continues to build things that bridge the digital and physical worlds — and occasionally sneaks off to play punk rock shows with his band.</p>
