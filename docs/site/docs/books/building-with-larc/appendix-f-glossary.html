        <h1>Glossary</h1>
<p>This glossary defines technical terms, LARC-specific concepts, and web standards references used throughout this manual. Terms are presented in alphabetical order with clear definitions and, where relevant, cross-references to related concepts.</p>
<h2>A</h2>
<strong>Adapter</strong>
A design pattern that converts one interface to another. In LARC contexts, adapters bridge LARC components with external libraries or non-standard APIs.
<strong>Attribute</strong>
An HTML element property set via markup (e.g., <code><my-component data-id="123"></code>). LARC components observe attributes through <code>observedAttributes</code> and respond to changes via <code>attributeChangedCallback()</code>.
<strong>Autonomous Custom Element</strong>
A Web Component that extends <code>HTMLElement</code> directly rather than extending built-in HTML elements. LARC components are autonomous custom elements. Compare with <em>Customized Built-in Element</em>.
<h2>B</h2>
<strong>Batch Update</strong>
An optimization technique that groups multiple state changes into a single render cycle, reducing unnecessary DOM operations and improving performance.
<strong>Binding</strong>
The connection between a data source and its visual representation. LARC uses event-driven updates rather than automatic data binding, giving developers explicit control over rendering.
<strong>Browser Event</strong>
Standard DOM events like <code>click</code>, <code>input</code>, or <code>submit</code>. LARC components listen to browser events and can translate them into PAN bus events for application-wide communication.
<strong>Bubble</strong>
Event propagation through the DOM tree from child to parent elements. Browser events bubble by default; custom events must explicitly enable bubbling via <code>bubbles: true</code>.
<h2>C</h2>
<strong>Callback</strong>
A function passed as an argument to another function, executed after a specific event or operation completes. LARC lifecycle methods (<code>connectedCallback</code>, <code>disconnectedCallback</code>) are callbacks invoked by the browser at specific times.
<strong>Composed</strong>
An event property that determines whether the event crosses Shadow DOM boundaries. Set via <code>composed: true</code> in event initialization. Essential for events that need to traverse shadow roots.
<strong>Component</strong>
A self-contained, reusable user interface element. In LARC, components are Web Components registered via <code>customElements.define()</code> and implementing standard lifecycle callbacks.
<strong>Custom Element</strong>
The Web Components standard for creating new HTML elements with custom behavior. LARC applications are built from custom elements. See also <em>Autonomous Custom Element</em>.
<strong>Customized Built-in Element</strong>
A Web Component that extends an existing HTML element (e.g., <code><button is="fancy-button"></code>). LARC primarily uses autonomous custom elements rather than customized built-ins.
<h2>D</h2>
<strong>Declarative</strong>
A programming style that describes <em>what</em> should happen rather than <em>how</em>. HTML templates are declarative. Contrast with <em>Imperative</em>.
<strong>Dependency Injection</strong>
A pattern where dependencies are provided to a component rather than created internally. LARC components receive the PAN bus reference rather than accessing a global singleton.
<strong>Dispatch</strong>
Sending an event to the PAN bus for other components to receive. Called via <code>this.pan.dispatch(eventType, detail)</code>.
<strong>DOM (Document Object Model)</strong>
The browser's representation of an HTML document as a tree of objects. LARC components manipulate the DOM through standard APIs.
<h2>E</h2>
<strong>Element</strong>
A node in the DOM tree representing an HTML tag. Custom elements are specialized elements with developer-defined behavior.
<strong>Emit</strong>
Synonym for <em>dispatch</em>. Some frameworks use "emit" for event publication. LARC prefers "dispatch" to align with standard DOM terminology.
<strong>Encapsulation</strong>
Hiding internal implementation details from external code. Shadow DOM provides style encapsulation; JavaScript class private fields provide data encapsulation.
<strong>Event</strong>
A signal indicating something happened. Browser events (clicks, inputs) and custom events (PAN bus messages) both use the Event API.
<strong>Event Target</strong>
Any object that can receive events and have listeners registered on it. All DOM nodes are event targets; the PAN bus is also an event target.
<h2>F</h2>
<strong>Fragment</strong>
A <code>DocumentFragment</code> is a lightweight container for DOM nodes that can be manipulated off-screen and inserted into the document in one operation, reducing reflows.
<strong>Framework</strong>
A comprehensive library providing structure and conventions for application development. LARC is a lightweight component architecture rather than a full framework, emphasizing web standards.
<h2>H</h2>
<strong>HTML Template</strong>
The <code><template></code> element stores client-side content that won't render until explicitly instantiated. Useful for defining reusable markup structures.
<strong>Hydration</strong>
The process of attaching event listeners and state to server-rendered HTML. LARC components hydrate automatically when defined via <code>customElements.define()</code>.
<h2>I</h2>
<strong>Imperative</strong>
A programming style describing <em>how</em> to accomplish a task through explicit instructions. JavaScript is imperative. Contrast with <em>Declarative</em>.
<strong>Intersection Observer</strong>
A browser API for efficiently detecting when elements enter or leave the viewport. Used for lazy loading, infinite scroll, and visibility tracking.
<h2>L</h2>
<strong>LARC (Lightweight Asynchronous Reactive Components)</strong>
The component architecture described in this manual, emphasizing web standards, minimal abstraction, and explicit communication patterns.
<strong>Lifecycle</strong>
The sequence of states a component passes through: creation, attachment to DOM, updates, and removal. LARC components implement standard Web Components lifecycle callbacks.
<strong>Lifecycle Callback</strong>
Methods invoked by the browser at specific points in a component's lifecycle: <code>constructor()</code>, <code>connectedCallback()</code>, <code>disconnectedCallback()</code>, <code>attributeChangedCallback()</code>, <code>adoptedCallback()</code>.
<strong>Light DOM</strong>
Regular DOM content, as opposed to Shadow DOM. Content placed inside a custom element's tags lives in the light DOM and can be redistributed via <code><slot></code>.
<h2>M</h2>
<strong>Microtask</strong>
A JavaScript task scheduled via <code>Promise.then()</code> or <code>queueMicrotask()</code>. Microtasks run before the browser's next rendering cycle, useful for batching updates.
<strong>Module</strong>
An ES6 module (<code>import</code>/<code>export</code>) that encapsulates code. LARC components are typically defined as modules, one component per file.
<strong>Mutation Observer</strong>
A browser API for watching DOM changes. Less commonly needed in LARC since components manage their own rendering.
<h2>N</h2>
<strong>Namespace</strong>
A prefix used to group related events or APIs. LARC encourages namespacing PAN bus events (e.g., <code>user:login</code>, <code>user:logout</code>) for better organization.
<strong>Node</strong>
A basic DOM building block. Elements, text, and comments are all nodes. Components manipulate nodes through standard DOM APIs.
<h2>O</h2>
<strong>Observer Pattern</strong>
A design pattern where objects (observers) subscribe to state changes in another object (subject). The PAN bus implements the observer pattern.
<strong>observedAttributes</strong>
A static getter on custom element classes listing attributes the component wants to monitor. Changes trigger <code>attributeChangedCallback()</code>.
<h2>P</h2>
<strong>PAN Bus (Publish-and-subscribe Asynchronous Notification Bus)</strong>
LARC's event system for component communication. Components dispatch events to the bus and subscribe to events they care about, enabling loose coupling.
<strong>Polyfill</strong>
JavaScript code that implements modern features in older browsers. Web Components polyfills enable LARC applications to run in browsers without native support.
<strong>Prop (Property)</strong>
Short for "property," data passed to a component. In LARC, complex data typically flows through PAN bus events rather than attributes, since attributes are limited to strings.
<strong>Publish-Subscribe</strong>
A messaging pattern where publishers send messages to topics/channels, and subscribers receive messages from those topics. The PAN bus is a pub-sub system.
<h2>R</h2>
<strong>Reactive</strong>
A programming model where the UI automatically updates in response to data changes. LARC components implement reactivity explicitly through PAN bus subscriptions rather than automatic binding.
<strong>Reconciliation</strong>
The process of determining minimal DOM changes needed to reflect new state. LARC leaves reconciliation to developers or optional libraries rather than providing built-in virtual DOM diffing.
<strong>Render</strong>
Convert data into visual representation. In LARC, rendering is explicit—components call their own <code>render()</code> methods when appropriate.
<strong>Reflow</strong>
The browser's process of recalculating element positions and dimensions. Excessive reflows hurt performance. LARC's batch updates minimize reflows.
<h2>S</h2>
<strong>Scoped Styles</strong>
CSS that applies only to a specific component without affecting other elements. Shadow DOM provides automatic style scoping.
<strong>Shadow DOM</strong>
A web standard for attaching encapsulated DOM trees to elements. Shadow DOM provides style and markup encapsulation, preventing styles from leaking in or out.
<strong>Shadow Host</strong>
The element to which a shadow root is attached. When you call <code>this.attachShadow()</code> on a custom element, that element becomes the shadow host.
<strong>Shadow Root</strong>
The root of a shadow DOM tree, created via <code>element.attachShadow()</code>. Content inside the shadow root is isolated from the main document.
<strong>Slot</strong>
A Shadow DOM feature for distributing light DOM content into shadow DOM. Defined with <code><slot></code> elements and allowing flexible content composition.
<strong>State</strong>
Data that determines component appearance and behavior. LARC encourages explicit state management through component properties and PAN bus events.
<strong>Subscribe</strong>
Registering a listener for events on the PAN bus. Called via <code>this.pan.subscribe(eventType, handler)</code>, returns an unsubscribe function.
<h2>T</h2>
<strong>Template</strong>
Reusable markup structure. Can refer to HTML <code><template></code> elements or template literals (backtick strings) used for generating HTML.
<strong>Template Literal</strong>
JavaScript's backtick string syntax supporting multiline strings and interpolation. Commonly used for component templates: `<code> </code><div>${value}</div><code> </code><code>.
<strong>Throttle</strong>
Limiting function execution frequency. Unlike debouncing (which delays until activity stops), throttling ensures a function runs at most once per time interval.
<h2>U</h2>
<strong>Unsubscribe</strong>
Removing a listener from the PAN bus. The function returned by </code>subscribe()<code> acts as an unsubscribe callback, essential for preventing memory leaks.
<strong>User Agent</strong>
The browser or other software accessing a web application. User agent strings identify the browser type and version.
<h2>V</h2>
<strong>Virtual DOM</strong>
An in-memory representation of the DOM used to calculate minimal changes before applying them. LARC doesn't include built-in virtual DOM, preferring explicit control or optional libraries.
<h2>W</h2>
<strong>Web Component</strong>
An umbrella term for three standards: Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and HTML Templates. LARC applications are built on Web Components.
<strong>Web Standards</strong>
Specifications maintained by standards bodies (W3C, WHATWG) defining how web technologies work. LARC prioritizes web standards over proprietary abstractions.
<h2>LARC-Specific Terms</h2>
<strong>Component Bus</strong>
A dedicated PAN bus instance for a specific component subtree. Allows isolated event scopes within larger applications. Most applications use a single global bus.
<strong>Component Tree</strong>
The hierarchical structure of custom elements in an application. Events and data flow through this tree via the PAN bus.
<strong>Event Detail</strong>
The </code>detail<code> property of a custom event, containing application-specific data. PAN bus events place their payload in the detail object.
<strong>Event Type</strong>
A string identifying an event category (e.g., </code>'user:login'<code>, </code>'data:loaded'<code>). LARC encourages namespaced, descriptive event types.
<strong>Pan Property</strong>
The </code>pan<code> property on custom elements, providing access to the PAN bus. Automatically injected by LARC's component initialization.
<strong>Reactive Primitive</strong>
Basic reactive building blocks like reactive objects, computed values, and watchers. LARC's optional reactivity system provides these as lightweight utilities.
<strong>Unidirectional Data Flow</strong>
An architecture where data flows in one direction through an application. LARC encourages this through PAN bus events: components dispatch actions upward and listen for state changes downward.
<h2>Web Standards References</h2>
<strong>CustomElementRegistry</strong>
The browser's registry of defined custom elements, accessed via </code>window.customElements<code>. Provides </code>define()<code>, </code>get()<code>, </code>whenDefined()<code>, and </code>upgrade()<code> methods.
<strong>Event.prototype.composed</strong>
Boolean property indicating whether an event crosses shadow DOM boundaries during event propagation.
<strong>Event.prototype.bubbles</strong>
Boolean property indicating whether an event propagates up the DOM tree from its target.
<strong>HTMLElement</strong>
The base interface for HTML elements. All LARC components extend </code>HTMLElement<code> or its subclasses.
<strong>MutationObserver API</strong>
Interface for observing DOM mutations. Occasionally useful for LARC components that need to react to external DOM changes.
<strong>ShadowRoot</strong>
Interface representing the root of a shadow DOM tree, providing methods like </code>querySelector()<code> that operate within the shadow scope.
<strong>shadowRoot.mode</strong>
The encapsulation mode of a shadow root: </code>'open'<code> (accessible via </code>element.shadowRoot<code>) or </code>'closed'<code> (inaccessible from outside). LARC recommends open mode for testability.

<h2>Related Concepts</h2>
<strong>Component Lifecycle</strong>
See <em>Lifecycle</em> and <em>Lifecycle Callback</em>.
<strong>Custom Events</strong>
Events created via </code>new CustomEvent()` rather than browser-generated events. PAN bus events are custom events.
<strong>Event-Driven Architecture</strong>
An architectural pattern where components communicate through events rather than direct method calls. LARC's PAN bus enables event-driven architecture.
<strong>Loose Coupling</strong>

<strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>
Design principle where different aspects of functionality are handled by different components. LARC components encapsulate specific UI concerns, communicating via well-defined events.
<strong>Single Responsibility Principle</strong>
Each component should have one clear purpose. LARC encourages focused components that do one thing well.
