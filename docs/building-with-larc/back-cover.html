<h2 id="the-web-has-grown-up.-its-time-our-apps-did-too.">The Web Has
Grown Up. It’s Time Our Apps Did Too.</h2>
<p>Modern browsers aren’t the brittle playgrounds they once were.
They’re fast, secure, richly capable application platforms — yet most of
today’s development stacks still treat them like dumb terminals that
need layers of tooling, bundling, and framework magic just to
function.</p>
<p><strong>Learning LARC</strong> shows another path.</p>
<p>LARC embraces the browser as a mature runtime, using nothing but open
standards — Web Components, modules, events, and message buses — to
build complex, deeply interactive applications without build systems,
without monoliths, and without ceremony. Through clear narrative
examples and real architectural stories, this book teaches you how to
design apps as ecosystems: small parts, clearly defined, communicating
through a shared bus.</p>
<p>You’ll learn how to structure large systems out of tiny cooperating
modules, expose capabilities through message patterns instead of global
state, keep your interfaces clean, and let the platform do the heavy
lifting it was built for.</p>
<p>No bundlers. No scaffolding. No twenty-layer dependency stacks. Just
the browser, finally treated like the grown-up it is.</p>
<p>Whether you’re maintaining a legacy system or starting fresh,
<strong>Learning LARC</strong> will help you rethink how modern web apps
can — and should — be built.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h2>
<p>Christopher Robison is a veteran software engineer and architect with
nearly three decades of experience building systems that range from
biotech and online trading platforms to complex web applications and
AI-driven tools. A lifelong maker with a deep appreciation for open
standards, he has spent his career exploring the boundaries of what the
web can do when you stop fighting the platform and start embracing
it.</p>
<p>He is the creator of LARC.js and the PAN message bus, a
browser-native architecture inspired by the elegant simplicity of the
automotive CAN bus. His work blends engineering pragmatism with a
playful curiosity that has led him to design everything from 3D printers
and robotics to interactive music systems and decentralized
applications.</p>
<p>Christopher currently lives in San Francisco, where he continues to
build things that bridge the digital and physical worlds — and
occasionally sneaks off to play punk rock shows with his band.</p>
