## 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Launch)

### 1. **CRITICAL: Missing Playground Demo**

**Impact:** HIGH - This is your primary showcase!

**Issue:**
- README and HN post reference: `https://larcjs.com/playground/`
- HN FAQ mentions playground multiple times
- **Playground directory does not exist in repository**
- Cannot verify if GitHub Pages is properly configured

**Why This Matters:**
- First thing HN users will click
- Broken demo = immediate credibility loss
- "Don't show HN with broken demos" is cardinal rule

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Verify these URLs work:
- https://larcjs.com/playground/
- https://larcjs.com/examples/
- https://larcjs.com/
```

**Recommendation:**
- Test all demo URLs before posting
- If playground is missing, remove references or build it
- Consider using StackBlitz or CodeSandbox as temporary solution

---

### 2. **Version Inconsistency**

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Confusing for users

**Issue:**
- README says packages are v2.0.0
- npm registry shows v3.0.1
- HN FAQ says v1.1 in multiple places

**Example from README.md:**
```markdown
**Core Packages:**
- **`@larcjs/core`** (v2.0.0) - Full-featured messaging bus  ← WRONG
- **`@larcjs/core-lite`** (v2.0.0) - Lightweight 9KB version  ← WRONG
```

**Actual versions on npm:**
- @larcjs/core: 3.0.1 ✓
- @larcjs/ui: 3.0.1 ✓

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Update these files:
- README.md (line 68-70, line 303-311)
- docs/guides/HN_FAQ.md (multiple references to v1.1)
- docs/guides/HN_POST_DRAFT.md (line 42, line 113)
```

---

### 3. **Incomplete Production Readiness Claims**

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Sets wrong expectations

**Issue:**
In HN FAQ, you claim "production-ready" with these stats:
- ✅ 261 tests passing - CORRECT
- 🟡 "v1.1" - WRONG (it's v3.0.1)
- 🟡 "Nov 2024" launch - Is this accurate?
- ❌ No real production users listed

**Why This Matters:**
HN users will ask "Who's using this?" and you have no answer ready except "Early adopters."

**Recommendation:**
Be more honest about project maturity:
```markdown
**Current Status:**
- v3.0.1 released (January 2026)
- Young project, seeking early adopters
- Strong test coverage and security practices
- Perfect for new projects and design systems
- Use with caution for large enterprise apps
```

---

## 🟡 High-Priority Improvements (Should Fix Before Launch)

### 1. **Verify All Live Links**

Test every URL mentioned in launch materials:

```bash
# From HN post draft:
✓ https://github.com/larcjs/larc
? https://larcjs.com/playground/  # CRITICAL
? https://larcjs.com/
? https://larcjs.com/examples/
? https://larcjs.com/examples/hybrid-dashboard/
✓ https://npmjs.com/package/@larcjs/core
✓ https://github.com/larcjs/core/discussions
✓ https://discord.gg/zjUPsWTu
```

**Status:** UNKNOWN - Need manual verification

---

### 2. **First Impression Issues**

**Homepage/Landing Experience:**
- README is very long (331 lines)
- "Using LARC" section is buried
- No immediate "Try it now" demo
- Installation instructions not prominent enough

**Recommendation:**
Restructure README with sections:
1. **Hero:** What is LARC? (2-3 sentences)
2. **Quick Demo:** Live playground link
3. **Install:** One command to get started
4. **Key Features:** Bullet points
5. **Everything else:** Below the fold

---

### 3. **Bundle Size Claims**

**Issue:** Multiple size claims that are inconsistent:

From README:
- "9KB core-lite"
- "5KB core (gzipped)"
- "~3KB gzipped" (core-lite)

From HN FAQ:
- "9KB minified (~3KB gzipped)" ✓
- "40KB minified (12KB gzipped)" - for full core

**Recommendation:**
Pick ONE authoritative source and be consistent:
```markdown
**Bundle Sizes (minified/gzipped):**
- @larcjs/core-lite: 9KB / 3KB (recommended for production)
- @larcjs/core: 40KB / 12KB (includes debug + routing)
- @larcjs/ui components: ~7KB / 2KB per component (average)
```

---

### 4. **Security.md Issues**

**Minor Issue:** SECURITY.md lists:
```markdown
| @larcjs/core | 1.1.x | ✅ Yes |
| @larcjs/core | 1.0.x | ✅ Yes |
```

But current version is 3.0.1, so this is outdated.

**Action Required:**
Update security support table to reflect current versions.
