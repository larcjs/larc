## About This Book

"Learning LARC" is a comprehensive, narrative guide to building modern web applications using the LARC framework and web standards. Unlike reference manuals, this book teaches through progressive examples, real-world patterns, and practical applications.

### What Makes This Book Different

- **Narrative Approach**: Learn through stories and progression, not just API docs
- **Web Standards First**: Everything builds on platform capabilities
- **No Build Required**: Develop without complex toolchains
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, scale as needed
- **Real-World Examples**: Practical patterns you'll actually use
