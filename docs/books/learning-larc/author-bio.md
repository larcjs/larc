## About the Author

Christopher Robison is a veteran software engineer and architect with nearly three 
decades of experience building systems that range from biotech and online trading 
platforms to complex web applications and AI-driven tools. A lifelong maker with 
a deep appreciation for open standards, he has spent his career exploring the 
boundaries of what the web can do when you stop fighting the platform and start 
embracing it.

He is the creator of LARC.js and the PAN message bus, a browser-native architecture 
inspired by the elegant simplicity of the automotive CAN bus. His work blends engineering 
pragmatism with a playful curiosity that has led him to design everything from 
3D printers and robotics to interactive music systems and decentralized applications.

Christopher currently lives in San Francisco, where he continues to build things that 
bridge the digital and physical worlds — and occasionally sneaks off to play punk 
rock shows with his band.
