## The Web Has Grown Up. It’s Time Our Apps Did Too.

Modern browsers aren’t the brittle playgrounds they once were. They’re fast, secure, 
richly capable application platforms — yet most of today’s development stacks still 
treat them like dumb terminals that need layers of tooling, bundling, and framework 
magic just to function.

**Learning LARC** shows another path.

LARC embraces the browser as a mature runtime, using nothing but open standards — 
Web Components, modules, events, and message buses — to build complex, deeply 
interactive applications without build systems, without monoliths, and without 
ceremony. Through clear narrative examples and real architectural stories, this 
book teaches you how to design apps as ecosystems: small parts, clearly defined, 
communicating through a shared bus.

You’ll learn how to structure large systems out of tiny cooperating modules, expose 
capabilities through message patterns instead of global state, keep your interfaces 
clean, and let the platform do the heavy lifting it was built for.

No bundlers. No scaffolding. No twenty-layer dependency stacks.
Just the browser, finally treated like the grown-up it is.

Whether you’re maintaining a legacy system or starting fresh, **Learning LARC** will 
help you rethink how modern web apps can — and should — be built.
