<h2 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h2>
<p>Christopher Robison is a veteran software engineer and architect with
nearly three decades of experience building systems that range from
biotech and online trading platforms to complex web applications and
AI-driven tools. A lifelong maker with a deep appreciation for open
standards, he has spent his career exploring the boundaries of what the
web can do when you stop fighting the platform and start embracing
it.</p>
<p>He is the creator of LARC.js and the PAN message bus, a
browser-native architecture inspired by the elegant simplicity of the
automotive CAN bus. His work blends engineering pragmatism with a
playful curiosity that has led him to design everything from 3D printers
and robotics to interactive music systems and decentralized
applications.</p>
<p>Christopher currently lives in San Francisco, where he continues to
build things that bridge the digital and physical worlds — and
occasionally sneaks off to play punk rock shows with his band.</p>
